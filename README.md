# Task-Tracker-App

* TaskTracker is a task delegation and reward-tracking app designed for people living with roommates or housemates. 
* It allows users to assign individual tasks, monitor task status from a shared view, track rewards for going above and beyond, and change coordinators cyclically to promote engagement. 
* The app also provides custom reminders or alarms for individual tasks and illustrative graphical summaries/charts for tracking progress, individual performance, and the history of distributed rewards. 
* TaskTracker is designed for everyone but is especially helpful for people living with roommates or housemates. 
* Our goal is to make sharing chores and tasks easier, more efficient, and more rewarding.
